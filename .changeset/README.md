# Changesets

## How it works

1. When you make changes, run `pnpm changeset` to create a changeset
2. Choose the bump type (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a description of your changes
4. Commit the changeset file
5. When merged to `main`, the release workflow will:
   - Version bump all packages together (fixed versioning)
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Publish `xtarterize` CLI to npm
   - Create a GitHub release

## Internal packages

`@xtarterize/core`, `@xtarterize/patchers`, and `@xtarterize/tasks` are marked as `private: true` and won't be published to npm. They share version numbers with the CLI through fixed versioning.
